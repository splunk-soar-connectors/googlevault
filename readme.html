<h3>Service Account</h3>
  <p>
    This app requires a pre-configured service account to operate. Please follow the procedure outlined at <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7378726?hl=en" target="_blank">this link</a> to create a service account.<br>
    The following APIs will need to be enabled:
    <ul>
      <li>AdminSDK</li>
      <li>G Suite Vault API</li>
    </ul>
    At the end of the creation process, the admin console should ask you to save the config as a JSON file. Copy the contents of the JSON file in the clipboard and paste it as the value of the "Contents of Service Account JSON file" asset configuration parameter.
  </p>
<h3>Scopes</h3>
  <p>
    Once the service account has been created and APIs enabled, the next step is to configure scopes on these APIs to allow the App to access them. Every action requires different scopes to operate, these are listed in the action documentation.<br>To enable scopes please complete the following steps:
    <ul>
      <li>Go to your G Suite domain's <a href="http://admin.google.com/" target="_blank">Admin console.</a></li>
      <li>Select <b>Security</b> from the list of controls. If you don't see <b>Security</b> listed, select <b>Show More</b> from the gray bar at the bottom of the page, then select <b>Security</b> from the list of controls. If you can't see the controls, make sure you're signed in as an administrator for the domain.</li>
      <li>Select <b>API controls</b> in the <b>Access and data control</b> section.</li>
      <li>Select <b>MANAGE DOMAIN WIDE DELEGATIONS</b> in the <b>Domain wide delegation</b> section.</li>
      <li>Select <b>Add new</b> in the API clients section</li>
      <li>In the <b>Client Name</b> field enter the service account's <b>Client ID</b>. You can find your service account's client ID in the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials" target="_blank">Service accounts credentials page</a> or the service account JSON file (key named <b>client_id</b>).</li>
      <li>In the <b>One or More API Scopes</b> field enter the list of scopes that you wish to grant access to the App. For example, to enable all the scopes required by this app enter: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/ediscovery, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/ediscovery.readonly, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.orgunit.readonly, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly</li>
      <li>Click <b>Authorize</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>If the user provides Organization ID of the root level organization instead of the child organizations (in which export is to be created) in the action <b>create export</b>, API might throw an error <b>'Domain wide search is disabled'</b> or <b>'Select an organizational unit other than the root'</b> based on the configurations of the Google Vault.</li>
  </ul>
